## 1 Obstacle check: Continuous vs Triggered-based
1. Continuous: The obstacle check is executed in each frame:
  - Pros:
    - No need for user's input
    - Always up to date with the changes in the environment
  - Cons:
    - A flurry of information regarding position of obstacles
    - Possibly computanional heavy :blush:
2. Triggered-based: The obstacles check is executed every time the user demands it (via voice or hand input):
  - Pros:
    - Less raycasts to be used
  - Cons:
    - Not up to date with the changes in the environment
    - Need for a repetitive action from the user

## 2. Raycasts Source: Multiple vs Single
1. Multiple: Raycasts are sent from multiple positions in horizontal direction
   - 9 points in front of the user and one behond of the user
   - 0° angle
2. Single: Raycasts are sent from a single point in different angles
   - Single point: Head of the user or the point between head and floor
   - 9 raycasts in 45° (TBD) angle
   - A lot more computations are necessary

## 3. Alarm Box: Position
1. Fixed position
   - Boxes are placed around the user
   - The number of boxes is equal with the number of raycasts
   - They have a specific distance from the user
     - Alt: we change the distance of the boxes in the horizontal plane until a specific thread limit
   - They follow user's gaze (not applicable in 1.2)
   - We control the volume of the alarm based on the distance of the user from the box (if the distance is fixed)
2. Dynamic positions (not applicable in scenario 1.1)
   - Boxes are created/placed on the raycast hit point
   - Idea: Boxes are not created after a limit thread of distance
   - Boxes are deleted when they are not necessary

## 4. Glossary
- **Obstacles check**: the act of using raycasts in order to check for possible obstacles near the user
- **Alarm**: The sound, which warns the user for an obstacle
- **Alarm Box**: The object in which the alarm is attached to
